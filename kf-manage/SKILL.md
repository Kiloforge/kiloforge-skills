# Track Manager

Manage the complete track lifecycle including archiving, restoring, deleting, renaming, and cleaning up orphaned artifacts.

## Use this skill when

- Archiving, restoring, renaming, or deleting Kiloforge tracks
- Listing track status or cleaning orphaned artifacts
- Managing the track lifecycle across active, completed, and archived states

## Do not use this skill when

- Kiloforge is not initialized in the repository
- You lack permission to modify track metadata or files
- The task is unrelated to Kiloforge track management

## Instructions

- Verify `.agent/kf/` structure (including `tracks.yaml`) before proceeding.
- Determine the operation mode from arguments or interactive prompts.
- Confirm destructive actions (delete/cleanup) before applying.
- Use `.agent/kf/bin/kf-track` CLI to update `tracks.yaml` and track metadata consistently.
- If detailed steps are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Safety

- Backup track data before delete operations.
- Avoid removing archived tracks without explicit approval.

## Resources

- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed modes, prompts, and workflows.
